This folder contains codes and figures comparing the runs based on the KS test between the Additive TMCMC and the RWMH 

approaches. Any user using this must first run the "diffeomorphism.R" code and then "metropolis_sampler_diffeomorphism.R" 

code...The first code just installs the packages and all


The R codes "TMCMC_with_and_wo_diffeomorphism.R" and "MCMC_with_and_wo_diffeomorphism.R" performs the comparison with and 

without diffeomorphism for the t distribution and the Cauchy distribution (ust correct for the distribution).
